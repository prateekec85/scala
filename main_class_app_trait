-----------------------------------Main class and App Trait----------------------------
main method can be declared only in object not in class. Example is below.
object HelloWorld {
   def main(args : Array[String]) :Unit = {
     println("Hello World")
   }
}

this is similar to java public static void main(String[] args). 
public :- every method is by default public in scala. 
static:- There is no concept like static in scala but a bit similar concept is singleton object thus main method is present in object
void:- Unit is the scala counterpart for void.
String[] :- input argument in java and scala version is same.


App trait
Trait in scala is something similar to Interface in java.
We can reduce a lot of code in above by using App trait like below.

object HelloWorldTrait extends App {
        println("Hello World")
}
